# Valgrind automatic tests suite (VATS) for Zsh

## Fundamental test-configuration

Main configuration-file is `vtest.conf`. It defines two settings:

```zsh
test_bin="local-zsh"        # Binary that runs any test (local-zsh: ../Src/zsh)
zsh_control_bin="zsh"       # Binary used when scheduling tests & interpreting Valgrind output
```

Variable `zsh_control_bin` is used to implement special `#!`, shebang behavior: `runtests.zsh` starts with `#!/bin/sh`,
reads `vtest.conf`, and restarts with `zsh_control_bin`. This way user can define shebang interpreter via separate
configuration file (`vtest.conf`).

The second script that uses `zsh_control_bin` is `zsh-valgrind-parse.cmd`. It also restarts via `#!/bin/sh` and
`exec /usr/bin/env "$zsh_control_bin"`.

The setting `test_bin` specifies Zsh binary used to run tests. **This binary is examined by Valgrind**. Special value
`local-zsh` means: *Zsh binary from current build directory*, normally `../Src/zsh`. This is the default.

## Remaining test-configuration

The setting `tkind` is used to set a **test-kind**. These are modes of Valgrind operation. Allowed values are: `error`
(only detect read/write errors), `leak` (also detect memory leaks), `nopossiblylost` (detect memory leaks, but not
_possibly_ lost blocks).

```zsh
tkind="leak"                # Test kind: error, leak, nopossiblylost
```
